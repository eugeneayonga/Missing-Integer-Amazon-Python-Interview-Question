# Missing-Integer-Amazon-Python-Interview-Question

"""Missing Integer [Amazon Python Interview Question]

Given an input list containing n distinct numbers in the range 0 to n, return the only number in the range that is missing from the list.

For example, given input = [0,1,3], return 2. Because the input list has 3 elements in it, we expect to see the numbers 0 to 3 in there, but 2 is missing.

Another example: given input = [4, 3, 2, 1], return 0. We return 0 becuase the input list has 4 elements in it, so we expect to see the numbers 0 to 4 in there, but 0 itself is missing!
